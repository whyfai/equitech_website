            offline. Meanwhile, 8.8M people still engage in risky online activities. </h3>

        <p>Empowering Indonesian Youth in the Digital Age

            In an era where technology shapes every aspect of our lives, digital literacy has become more than just a skill—it’s a necessity. Despite Indonesia’s rapid internet growth, many teenagers still struggle with navigating digital platforms safely and effectively. Issues such as misinformation, cyber threats, and the digital divide between urban and rural communities highlight the urgent need for education on online safety and responsible digital use.
            
            Recognizing this challenge, NHS Sekolah Ciputra and EquiTech have joined forces to empower Indonesian teenagers with essential digital literacy and online safety awareness. Through interactive workshops, educational resources, and awareness campaigns, we aim to equip students with the knowledge and critical thinking skills needed to thrive in the digital world. Beyond safety, this initiative also opens doors to real-world job opportunities, ensuring that Indonesian youth are prepared for the future.
            
            Together, we are building a safer, smarter, and more digitally responsible generation.</p>

                <p style="padding-top: 4.5rem;">Digital literacy remains a significant issue in Indonesia despite the rapid growth of internet access. 
                    Many Indonesians lack the skills to navigate digital platforms safely and effectively, leading to problems such as misinformation, 
                    cyber threats, and online fraud. The digital divide between urban and rural areas further exacerbates the issue, 
                    as limited infrastructure and education hinder equal access to digital knowledge. 
                    Strengthening digital literacy is crucial to ensuring safe and productive technology use across all sectors.
